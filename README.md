# DUKPT Playground

This repository provides an implementation of the DUKPT (Derived Unique Key Per Transaction) key
management scheme in Go. It is focused on **educational purposes** and testing, rather than production use.

> Most of the code was written with Copilot (GPT-4.1) assistance in Agent mode.  
> Everything was reviewed, tested and often refactored, but the main logic came from the AI.
