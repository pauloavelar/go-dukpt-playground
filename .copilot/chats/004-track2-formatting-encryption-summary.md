# Chat Summary: Track 2 Data Formatting and Encryption in Go

## Overview

This chat focused on implementing and refining Track 2 data formatting and encryption for
payment card data in Go.

The user requested a series of improvements to their codebase, including:
- Formatting Track 2 data according to ISO/IEC 7813 and alternative standards.
- Avoiding code duplication by using a generic formatting function.
- Refactoring to use numeric fields for expiration year and month, and later using `uint8` for type safety.
- Using BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) encoding for all numeric fields, and moving BCD logic to a dedicated package.
- Improving buffer allocation for performance.
- Converting formatting functions to methods on a `Data` struct.
- Renaming methods for clarity and conciseness.
- Supporting custom formatting and encryption workflows.

## Key Steps and Decisions

1. **Initial Formatting Functions**: Implemented two formatting functions for Track 2 data,
   one for ISO/IEC 7813 (`=` separator) and one for the alternative (`D` separator), using a
   shared internal function to avoid code duplication.
2. **Struct Refactoring**: Changed the Track 2 data struct to use separate numeric fields for
   expiration year and month, and then to `uint8` for both fields.
3. **BCD Encoding**: Refactored the formatting logic to output BCD-encoded byte arrays for all
   numeric fields, as required by the Track 2 standard.
4. **Buffer Optimization**: Calculated the necessary buffer capacity in advance to avoid
   reallocations during formatting.
5. **BCD Utility Package**: Moved all BCD-related functions to a new `bcd` package for reuse and clarity.
6. **Method Conversion**: Converted all formatting functions to methods on the `Data` struct,
   and renamed them to remove redundancy (e.g., `FormatISO`, `FormatAlt`).
7. **Encryption Flexibility**: Added support for encrypting both struct-based and manually formatted
   Track 2 data, allowing for custom sentinels and separators.
8. **Constraints and Generics**: Discussed Go's `constraints` package for generics, but ultimately
   kept BCD conversion focused on the required types.

## Notable Code Changes

- `track2.Data` struct now encapsulates all Track 2 fields and formatting logic.
- `bcd` package provides `ToBCD`, `Uint8ToBCD`, and related helpers.
- Formatting methods on `Data` return BCD-encoded byte slices, ready for encryption.
- Encryption functions accept both formatted strings and struct data, supporting custom formatting.

## Best Practices Applied

- **Code Reuse**: Shared logic for formatting and BCD conversion.
- **Type Safety**: Used `uint8` for month/year where appropriate.
- **Performance**: Pre-allocated buffers for formatting.
- **Extensibility**: Modularized BCD logic and formatting methods.
- **Idiomatic Go**: Used methods on structs and clear naming conventions.

## Next Steps

- Add more tests for edge cases (e.g., invalid PAN, year/month values).
- Consider further validation or error handling for BCD conversion.
- Document the public API for the `track2` and `bcd` packages.
