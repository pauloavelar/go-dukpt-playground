- User requested an .editorconfig file for Go code with community standards. I created it with tabs for indentation,
  LF line endings, UTF-8 encoding, and trailing whitespace trimming.
- The user then asked to set max line length to 140 for Go files, which I added.
- Next, the user requested the same max line length for Markdown files, and I updated the file accordingly.
- The final .editorconfig sets these standards for both Go and Markdown files.
