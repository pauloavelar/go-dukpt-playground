# Conversation Summary: DUKPT Track2 Encryption Implementation

## Overview
The user is developing a Go package to format and encrypt track2 data from a card using DUKPT (Derived Unique Key Per Transaction).
The focus is on creating an informative, well-documented, and distributable package for their team. The conversation covers
implementation details, code review, and cryptographic best practices.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Implementation Approach

- The user requested to focus on encryption logic first, deferring API and documentation improvements.
- The user asked about the possibility of manually editing code before proceeding with further AI-generated changes.

### 2. DUKPT Libraries and Standards

- The user inquired about the existence of DUKPT or IPEK derivation code in the Go standard library (none exists).
- The user asked about well-known third-party libraries for DUKPT in Go.

### 3. Code Review and Key Handling

- The user expressed concern about the use of `append` when constructing the 3DES key, specifically whether it 
  could unintentionally modify the underlying slice (`keyL`) if it has extra capacity.
- The assistant clarified that `append` may modify the original slice if it has sufficient capacity, but in the
  context shown, it was safe.

### 4. Key Construction and Normalization

- The assistant explained that 3DES requires a 24-byte key, and the standard practice is to use K1|K2|K1
  (where K1 and K2 are the two halves of the 16-byte BDK).
- The user requested extraction of this logic into a `normalizeKey` function.

### 5. KSN Masking and Bug Fixes

- The user identified a mistake in the KSN masking logic (should not use XOR) and requested a fix.

### 6. Session Key Derivation

- The assistant was asked to proceed with the session key derivation function, including comments and documentation
  but not excessive inline comments.

### 7. Next Steps

- The user plans to review and refactor the code, then return with questions about track2 formatting and padding formats.

## Files Involved

- `dukpt/dukpt.go`: Main implementation file for DUKPT logic.
- `dukpt/constants.go`, `dukpt/ipek.go`: Supporting files (not fully shown).

## Notable Code Snippets

- `normalizeKey`: Ensures a 16-byte key is expanded to 24 bytes for 3DES (K1|K2|K1).
- `deriveSessionKey`: Derives the session key from the IPEK and KSN, following DUKPT specifications.

## Outstanding Tasks

- Complete the session key derivation and encryption logic.
- Add documentation and comments as needed.
- Address track2 formatting and padding in future steps.
