# Chat Summary: EMV Tag 57 Track 2 Formatting and Validation Refactor (2025-07-18)

## Overview
This chat focused on refactoring and improving the Go implementation for EMV Track 2 Equivalent Data (tag 57)
formatting and validation in the `track2` package. The user requested a shift from magstripe/ISO formatting to
EMV-compliant logic, with a focus on correctness, readability, and maintainability. The discussion included
detailed questions about EMV and magstripe encoding, field validation, and Go documentation standards.

## Key Actions and Decisions

### 1. EMV Tag 57 Formatting
- Removed all magstripe/ISO-specific logic, including sentinels and legacy formatting.
- Implemented a single `Format` method for the `Data` struct to generate a human-readable EMV Track 2 Equivalent Data
  string, always using `=` as the separator and padding with `F` if the length is odd.
- Refactored the formatting logic to use a `strings.Builder` for improved readability and efficiency.

### 2. Field Validation
- Added a public `Validate` method to the `Data` struct, returning an `error` to provide descriptive error messages.
- Validation checks include:
  - PAN: Numeric, 10–19 digits (updated from 12–19 after user correction)
  - Expiry month: MM
  - Expiry year: YY
  - Service code: Exactly 3 numeric digits
  - Discretionary data: Up to 13 numeric digits
- Added `minLength` and `maxLength` struct tags to all fields for future reflection-based validation.

### 3. Documentation Improvements
- Updated Go doc comments for the `Data` struct and its fields to clearly specify requirements and constraints.
- Added references to EMV Book 3, Annex B1, and ISO/IEC 7812-1:2017(E) in the struct documentation.

### 4. Encoding and BCD Logic
- Clarified that EMV tag 57 values are BCD-encoded (packed nibbles), not ASCII or hex strings.
- Discussed separator encoding (`=` as 0xD) and padding rules.
- Outlined the difference between magstripe and EMV encoding, especially regarding sentinels.

### 5. Validator Utility
- The user provided an excerpt of `validator.go`, which uses reflection and struct tags for generic field validation.
- The chat set the stage for integrating the new struct tags and validation logic with this utility.

## Next Steps
- Integrate the new struct tags and validation logic with the generic validator utility in `validator.go`.
- Finalize and test the BCD encoding logic for EMV tag 57.
- Ensure all changes are covered by tests using `testify/require` as per project standards.

## References
- EMV Book 3, Annex B1
- ISO/IEC 7812-1:2017(E)
